          <p>
            Welcome to LibroVault, your new home for digital reading.
          </p>
          <p>
            Founded in 2025 by Sayan Hazra, LibroVault was born from a simple idea: in an age of digital clutter, our libraries should be smarter, more personal, and accessible from anywhere. We set out to create a single, beautiful, and intelligent platform for readers and creators alikeâ€”not just a place to store eBooks, but a true "vault" that enriches your knowledge and helps you discover your next great read.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our mission is to seamlessly blend technology with the timeless joy of reading, creating a personalized experience that's both powerful and easy to use.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white pt-4 border-t border-gray-700">What is LibroVault?</h3>
          <p>
            LibroVault is a smart eBook management system where you can build, browse, and read your digital collection. It's a community-driven platform where users can contribute to an ever-expanding library, with an administrative team ensuring quality and organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using powerful AI, LibroVault goes beyond simple storage. It learns from your reading habits to suggest new titles you'll love, automatically summarizes books, and even provides a voice assistant to read to you.
